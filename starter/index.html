      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>I first started getting to know a bit more about graphic design in September 2021,
        when I set up a little takeaway business and designed my own logo, menu and flyers.
        (HUS Burgers)
        I started my studies on Udemy and took a course on Adobe Illustrator.
        Shortly after I finished my first course, I subscribed to Skillshare and carried on learning new skills starting with Adobe Photoshop then onto InDesign, Premiere Pro, XD and After Effects.
        In one year, I made a lot of progress with these programs and learnt how to use most of them confidently.
